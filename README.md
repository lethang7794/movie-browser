## User Stories

<!-- TODO: 🔴🟠🟢 ADD USER STORIES -->

### The following **required** functionalities are completed:

- [x] The user can see the top 20 "Currently Playing" movies on a page.
- [x] For each movie, the user can see the Movie Title, Year, Rating, and Poster.
- [x] The user can see this information clearly on devices of various screen sizes.
- [x] The user can see "more" movies by tapping a "See More" button at the bottom.
- [x] Pagination: Replace the "See More" with a page control, with a previous and next Button at the end. Click it will move user to the next 20 (or previous 20) movies. Remember at first load, the Previous button should be disabled.
- [x] For each movie, include a link (movie/id) to display the full Movie Info on another page (URL). Use React Router for this.

### The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] 🚀 The user can enter a term into a search box to filter the currently loaded movies by search term. E.g.: the user can type "mar" and the results are reduced to show "Captain Marvel".
- [x] 🚀 The user can change the "source" from "Currently Playing" movies to "Top Rated" movies (or any other of the endpoints supplied by MovieDB).
- [ ] 🚀 Sort by Rating and Popularity (from Lowest to Highest and Vice Versa)
- [ ] 🚀 Have Year, Rating as a slider. Change the display dynamically when the slider is changed. You could use React Input Range package for this task.

### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] 🚀🚀🚀 This awesome README.md
- [x] Make the path for a movie friendly (contains both the movie id and title)
